Outline of class

Objects
-------
1. dictionary as pulled from YAML
   -- PRIVATE
2. list (or dictionary) of configuration keywords for variables with multiple
   possible default values
   -- PRIVATE
3. dictionary of varname / value pairs from input file
4. [Ordered] dictionary for varname / value pair (this_dict['varname'] = value
   -- PUBLIC
   -- varname should be what is seen in the input file (i.e. var_array(1) = val1)

Methods
-------

1. Constructor
   - INTENT(IN): YAML file name, input file name (or None), anything that needs
                 to be stored in object (2)
   i.   Set up object (2)
   ii.  Read YAML into object (1)
   iii. If present, read input file into object (3)
   iv.  Combine objects (1) and (3) into object (4)
       -- order matters! use category / subcategory / natural sorting

2. Get category names
   - PUBLIC
   - INTENT(IN): None
   - RETURN: the list in _order key of YAML file
   - consistency checks:
     i.   All keys in _order should also be in the YAML
     ii.  All keys in the YAML that don't begin with _ should be in _order
     iii. No duplicates in _order

3. Get subcategory names
   - PUBLIC
   - INTENT(IN): category name
   - RETURN: list of all subcategories in provided category

4. Get YAML variable names
   - PUBLIC
   - INTENT(IN): category name
   - RETURN: list of all variables in provided category
   - NOTE: do not expand arrays (return "arr" rather than "arr(1), arr(2), ...")

5. Get all variable names
   - PUBLIC
   - INTENT(IN): subcategory name
   - RETURN: list of keys for Object (4) that are variables in provided subcategory
   - NOTES: make subcategory optional? Could just return a full list?
            optional sort key argument?

6. Process variable values
   - PRIVATE
   - INTENT(IN): category name, variable name
   - RETURN: None
   - PURPOSE: Populate Object (4) based on contents of (1) and (3)
   i.   Arrays need to be expanded
   ii.  Derived types need to be expanded
   iii. Some derived types contain arrays that need to be expanded
   - REALLY WANT TO CLEAN THIS ROUTINE UP!

Module Functions / Subroutines
------------------------------

1. Abort
   - PRIVATE
   - Clean wrapper to sys.exit()

2. Get variable value
   - PRIVATE
   - If variable is in input file dict, return its value; otherwise return YAML value
   - Requires variable to be defined in YAML

3. Sort
   - PRIVATE
   - Wrapper for sorting lists, default is alphabetical but can take any key

4. Sort with specific suffix first
   - PRIVATE
   - In one case, we need to ensure that auto_ind_cnt and zoo_ind_cnt appear before auto_ind and zoo_ind

5. Natural Sort Key
   - PRIVATE
   - Sorts numbers in numeric order, so "word10" comes after "word9", not "word1"
   - Use as a key for Function (3)

6. Add increments
   - PRIVATE
   - Some values (such as tracer count) need to be adjusted depending on parameter values

7. Get dimension size
   - PRIVATE
   - Parses the "_array_size" key from YAML (can be integer value or refer to other YAML variable)

8. Get array info
   - PRIVATE
   - For arrays, return a list containing all the array indices, e.g. ["(1)", "(2)", ... ] for
     1D arrays or ["(1,1)", "(2,1)", ... ] for 2D arrays

9. String to Substring
   - PRIVATE
   - str.split(), unless the delimiter is inside quotes

10. Parse input file
   - PRIVATE
   - Read an input file line by line, return dictionary for each "varname = value" pair
   - Needs to recognize arrays, so "varname = 10, 20" -> "varname(1) = 10", "varname(2) = 20"
   - Ignore blank lines
   - Ignore comments (check to see if they are inside a string or not, though)
